🧬 GenomeDrugAI
AI-Powered Drug Recommendation System Based on Genomic Data for Indian Genetic Disorders

📌 Project Overview
GenomeDrugAI is a cutting-edge AI system that integrates genomic data analysis with domain knowledge from pharmacogenomics to recommend personalized drugs. The system leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to understand gene-drug interactions and uses Reinforcement Learning (RL) to adapt recommendations based on patient-specific dynamics and feedback.

This system is specifically tailored to address Indian genetic disorders, with a focus on rural and clinical applicability.

🚀 Features
🧠 Graph Neural Network (GNN) to model complex gene-drug relationships.
💊 PharmGKB Integration for high-confidence pharmacogenomic knowledge.
🔄 Reinforcement Learning Agent to dynamically personalize treatment.
🧬 Gene Ontology Enrichment for biologically meaningful recommendations.
📊 Model Analysis Tools to interpret and visualize predictions (SHAP, etc.).

🧪 How It Works
User inputs genomic data (e.g., SNP profiles).
data_processor.py prepares the genome into model-compatible features.
pharmgkb_processor.py extracts gene-drug relationships from PharmGKB data.
gene_ontology.py adds functional gene relationships.
gnn_model.py uses the structured graph to predict potential drug responses.
rl_drug_adaptation.py simulates personalized learning over time.
analysis.py visualizes results and explains model decisions.
